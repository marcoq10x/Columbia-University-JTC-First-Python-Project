# Marco Quintero: A Journey from the Soccer Field to Software Engineering

## Introduction
Greetings! I'm Marco Quintero. Born with the vibrant spirit of Colombia and raised in the serene oceans of the Bahamas,
I embarked on an athletic adventure in the USA, playing professional soccer. Life's unpredictable twists guided me through a 
journey of transformation from a maxillofacial oral surgeon to pursuing my passion for software engineering.

## Background and Education
My early years were spent between the lush landscapes of Colombia and the sun-kissed beaches of the Bahamas, a blend of 
cultures that shaped my worldly perspective. Played for the Men's Soccer NAtional Team of the Bahamas and moved to resume playing in the USA where shaping my discipline and 
teamwork skills took place. Later, I delved into the intricate world of oral maxillofacial surgery, acquiring a meticulous eye for detail and skill for meticulous work. 
Adversity struck, and with resilience, I pivoted toward technology, currently studying software engineering at Brigham Young University.

## Interests and Hobbies
Soccer remains my first love, a testament to my team spirit and strategic thinking. I soar the skies with hang gliding and skydiving, 
embracing the rush of adrenaline. Martial arts, including MMA, Nin-Jutsu, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, keep me grounded and disciplined.
My soul dances to the rhythm of music, as I play piano, guitar, and various wind instruments. Art flows through my veins; I sketch, 
paint, and etch with fire, expressing my creativity through pyrography.

## Professional Experience
My technical prowess spans Python, C#, and JavaScript, with a portfolio boasting software testing and development projects. Node.js and 
AI have been my recent playgrounds, culminating in the creation of a GPT for software engineering showcased in the ChatGPT store named "Code Wingman". 
From spinning up servers for websites to crafting mobile apps, I'm now gearing up to infuse AI into cloud-based applications.

## Future Goals
As I navigate the realm of software engineering, AI beckons me with its limitless possibilities. Cloud architecture calls for my attention, 
hinting at a future interwoven with innovation. Academically, a master's degree and perhaps a doctorate beckon, time and life being the deciding factors.
Above all, my heart yearns for a family, a home echoing with laughter and learning, where I can pass on the torch of knowledge and joy to my future children.
